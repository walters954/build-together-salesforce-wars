# Salesforce Star Wars Integration
### _[Salesforce Mentor - Build Together](https://courses.salesforcementor.com/)_

A month-long project you build on a team of 2-3 with other learning Salesforce developers. Small teams will work together to complete development assignments. A weekly meeting with experienced developers to go over questions and review code. Get actual hands-on experience by working on projects, in a team with requirements.

## Overview
Create an integration to retrieve Star Wars information from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) and store that information into standard Salesforce objects.
Practice Skills
- Apex Fundamentals 
- REST Integrations
- Data Transformation
- DML Operations

- REST Callout to SWAPI for Planets, People, Starships
- Process API responses  in individual wrapper classes per resource
- Put processed data into Salesforce objects

- Clone the forked repo onto your local computer and open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- Connect to your playground org and start coding!

- Must use SFDX, git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code
- Your code should be able to run in any playground org via a GitHub repo
- Must be able to commit to meeting weekly with a large group

## Resources
- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)
- [Trailhead - Apex Integration Services](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/apex_integration_services)
- [Apex Recipies - Integration Examples](https://github.com/trailheadapps/apex-recipes/tree/main/force-app/main/default/classes/Integration%20Recipes)

## Notes
- Build Together is meant to be challenging. You will be asked to figure things out with your team. Sr. Dev will guide you but not a full outline of what you should be doing. Asking questions is the more important thing.
- You can use other resources but don’t just copy it word for word. You should be able to explain what your code is doing.
- Team members are meant to keep each other accountable, but if a team member is not pulling their weight, they will be cut.
